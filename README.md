# WebGuard
Due to the growing prevalence of web vulnerabilities outlined by OWASP Top 10, WebGuardâ€™s core purpose is to protect users as they navigate around the internet. Acting as the middleman, it performs thorough checks on webpages to ensure a safe, secure, and seamless browsing experience. <br>

This browser extension will perform a series of essential security checks (targetting primarily on the Front-End), while also not tripping Security Controls in web pages. 
WebGuard is meant to be a simple-to-use browser extension, allowing any individuals regardless of their technical knowledge to be able to use it effectively.

## WebGuard Architecture
We built this project for our ICT2214 Web Security Module. The tool is built with Web Development Languages (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), and tested only in the Google Chrome Browser.
